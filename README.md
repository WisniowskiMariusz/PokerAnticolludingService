# PokerAnticolludingService
This is Python script which is looking for abnormal connections between players based on datamined poker hand histories.

Problem: Dishonest pokerplayers can cheat playing together in collusion.

Solution: We are searching and counting hands played by players together. When we estimate which values are "normal" (F.e. values for interested player which we assume is fair) we can also point out which connections are suspect.

Result: We are getting list of suspicious players which we can report or avoid depend on our strategy.
